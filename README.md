## What it is
This is a visualization of world happiness scores from 2015 to 2021. We show the geographical patterns of happiness scores with a color map. We used a line chart to display average happiness score of different regions (continents). A sorted bar chart is used to display the top X happiest countries by descending order. A pie chart of the different contributing factors of happiness score will be displayed when the mouse hovers over an area on the color map.
